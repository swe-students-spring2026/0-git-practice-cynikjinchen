[Report: AI hallucinates 27% of upgrade recommendations for open source projects](https://sdtimes.com/security/report-ai-hallucinates-27-of-upgrade-recommendations-for-open-source-projects/)

## My Reflection
This article explains that nowadays AI tools generate incorrect upgrade recommendations for open source projects about 27% of the time. These hallucinations involve suggesting non‑existent versions, incompatible dependencies, and unsafe upgrades. A majority of people rely on AI for automated dependency management without review. I find this report intriguing. As AI tools are becoming more powerful, even replacing a lot of human jobs, they still make systematic mistakes that can break builds or introduce security issues. It reminds me that software engineering always requires cautious human judgment, no matter the size of the adjustment. And we should balance AI automation with reliability in real-world engineering.
