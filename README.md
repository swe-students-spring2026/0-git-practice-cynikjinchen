[Report: AI hallucinates 27% of upgrade recommendations for open source projects](https://sdtimes.com/security/report-ai-hallucinates-27-of-upgrade-recommendations-for-open-source-projects/)

## My Reflection

This article explains that nowadays AI tools generate incorrect upgrade recommendations for open source projects about 27% of the time. These hallucinations involve suggesting non‑existent versions, incompatible dependencies, and unsafe upgrades. A majority of people rely on AI for automated dependency management without review. I find this report intriguing. As AI tools are becoming more powerful, even replacing a lot of human jobs, they still make systematic mistakes that can break builds or introduce security issues. It reminds me that software engineering always requires cautious human judgment, no matter the size of the adjustment. And we should balance AI automation with reliability in real-world engineering.

## Comment from Ethan

The article highlights the downsides of using AI in its current state. A hallucination rate of more than one quarter for open source projects is quite high and unreliable. I do believe that AI will continue on its current exponential path of improvement, but I can also see how it may not end up being the all-powerful tool some envision it to be in the future.

## Comment from Laiyi
Your reflection makes an important point that AI output is not the same as verified engineering work. The 27 percent hallucination rate is especially worrying for dependency upgrades because small version changes can break builds or introduce security risks. I like how you connect this to a practical takeaway, which is that teams should treat AI suggestions as drafts that still require human review, testing, and safe rollout.
